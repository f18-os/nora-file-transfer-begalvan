# File Transfer-Threaded Lab

CS 4375

Blanca Galv√°n ID# 88594199

Directory `thread-lab` includes: 

fileThreadClient.py and fileThreadServer.py.

For this lab assignment I received help from Abigail Lira to understand 
and implement the concept of "lock-acquire-release" for threads. Also used external resources 
and links for code reference and examples.
